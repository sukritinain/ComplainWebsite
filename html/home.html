    <p> Once you are out in a fancy restaurant <img id="restaurant" src="images/restaurant.png"> spending a nice time with your family, eating, drinking and enjoying <img id="music" src="images/music.png"/> but to your surprise you are not served well. The dish is served half cooked, the water tastes funny and your whole mood is spoiled. What do you do? Obviously you turn to the manager of the place.</p>
     <p> Here's how the conversation would normally turn out to be...<br /> <br />
       <img id="you" src="images/human1.png"/> You (angry and frustated): Why is the meal not cooked properly?? <br />
       <img id="manager" src="images/human2.png"/> Manager (apologising): I am sorry sir, I will have it changed. <br />
        <img id="you" src="images/human1.png"/> You: Also the water tastes awful!! <br />
        <img id="manager" src="images/human2.png"/>Manager: I am really sorry sir for your inconvenience, I will have it checked. <br />
       <img id="you" src="images/human1.png"/> You: I am really disgusted with your service.</p>
     <p> After that you are served what you desired and then you leave. Now its upto manager to overlook what happened or to make sure this never happens again!!</p>
     <p>But what did you take away from this experience?? "You probably will never visit it again."</p>
    <p>Now to avoid all this trouble, what if you would have known about its situation from somewhere...wouldn't it have helped you to avoid all this trouble and instead you would have spent a nice time with your family!!</p>
    <p>We bring you <b> "VIKALP" </b>, a website that provides a way for a person to raise his complaint against any issue in and around him. By doing this, he not only let his frustation out but also helps other people aware who may learn from his experience.</p>
    <p>If you might think you have been tricked, or you are unsatisfied by any service at any store, speak up and don't settle for less. Making other people aware will greatly help them in making decisions thereafter about a particular place.</p>
    <h4>So don't hesitate, don't hold back..Write and share your COMPLAINS!!'</h4>
